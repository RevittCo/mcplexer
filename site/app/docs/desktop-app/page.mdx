# Desktop App

The MCPlexer desktop app is an Electron wrapper around the web UI and Go binary. It provides a native application experience with system tray integration and OS-level notifications for tool approvals.

## Running from Source

Build the Go binary and web UI, then start the Electron app:

<TerminalBlock title="terminal">
{`make web-build
make go-build
cd electron && npm run dev`}
</TerminalBlock>

This starts the Electron app in development mode with hot-reload for the Electron shell. The Go binary runs as a child process managed by the Electron main process.

<Callout type="info" title="Prerequisites">
  You need Node.js, npm, Go, and make installed. Run `npm install` in the `electron/` directory on first setup.
</Callout>

## Features

### System Tray

The desktop app runs in the system tray, keeping MCPlexer available without a visible window. The tray icon shows the current status:

- **Running** — MCPlexer is active and processing tool calls
- **Stopped** — the Go process is not running

Right-click the tray icon for quick actions:

- Open the dashboard
- Start/stop the MCPlexer process
- View recent activity
- Quit the application

### Native Approval Notifications

When a tool call requires approval, the desktop app sends a native OS notification. This means you don't need to keep the browser or app window open — you'll get notified wherever you are.

Clicking the notification opens the approval detail view where you can approve or deny the request with full context.

<Callout type="tip" title="Approval workflow">
  Native notifications are especially useful when running MCPlexer in the background. Pair this with the [Tool Approvals](/docs/approvals) feature for a seamless approval workflow.
</Callout>

### Embedded Web UI

The desktop app embeds the same web UI available at `http://localhost:3333`. All dashboard features — metrics, audit logs, configuration pages — are available within the native window.

## Building
